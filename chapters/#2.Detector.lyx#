The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven Nation Laboratory
 (BNL) was built at year 1999, after nine years construction.
 It is deigned to accelerate and collide heavy ions and polarized protons
 at relativistic energy.
 RHIC has capabilities to deliver beams ranged from proton to uranium with
 high luminosity.
 The top center-of-mass collision energy is 200 GeV per nucleon pair for
 heavy ion collisions and 500 GeV for polarized p+p collisions.
 The basic design parameters of the collider are listed in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table: RHIC parameters"

\end_inset

.
 The main physics goal of RHIC is to investigate the phase transition from
 hadronic phase to QGP phase and to study the formation and property of
 QGP.
 RHIC also provides polarized p+p collision with collision energy up to
 500 GeV to expand the scientific objective of RHIC to include vigorous
 spin physics program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:RHIC overview"

\end_inset

 shows the layout of RHIC complex with the injector chain and the ring tunnel.
 The RHIC complex contains the Tandem van de Graaff pre-accelerator, a linear
 proton accelerator, the Booster Synchrotron, the Alternating Gradient Synchrotr
on (AGS) and and ultimately the RHIC synchrotron ring.
 The acceleration scenario for gold ion beams is shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 Negatively charged (
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{T}=-1$
\end_inset

) Au ions is injected into the Tandem Van de Graaff from the Pulsed Sputter
 Ion Source.
 They are partially stripped of their electrons and accelerated inside the
 Tandem Van de Graaff and exit with the energy of 1 MeV/nucleon and charge
 state of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{T}=+32$
\end_inset

.
 The ions are delivered to the Booster Synchrotron and accelerated to 95
 MeV/nucleon and further stripped to 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{T}=+77$
\end_inset

 at the exit.
 Then they are transferred into the AGS, where they are accelerated to 8.86
 GeV/nucleon and sorted into four final bunches.
 Ions are fully stripped (
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{T}=+79$
\end_inset

) at the exit of the AGS and transported to the RHIC storage rings though
 the AtR beamline.
 RHIC also has capability to provide polarized proton beams.
 Protons are injected from the 200 MeV Linac into the booster, followed
 by acceleration in the AGS and injection into RHIC.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
RHIC has two concentric super-conducting accelerator/storage rings, one
 (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Blue Ring
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) for clockwise and the other (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yellow Ring
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) for anti-clockwise beams.
 They are on a common horizontal plane in the tunnel with a circumference
 about 38 km.
 Each ring consists of six insertion sections with collision point at their
 center along its circumference.
 Two major experiments STAR and PHENIX are located at 6 o'clock and 8 o'clock,
 and two minor ones PHOBOS and BRAHMS were located at 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock,
 respectively.
 To date, RHIC has been configured to run in p+p, d+Au, Au+Au, Cu+Cu, Cu+Au
 and U+U collisions.

STAR experiment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC (STAR) is one of the two large detecter systems
 constructed at RHIC.
 Heavy ion collision at RHIC creates a nuclear environment of a large produced
 particles (up to approximately 1000 per unit pseudo-rapidity) and high
 momentum particles from hard parton-parton scattering.
 The main physics goal of the STAR experiment is to measure many observables
 simultaneously to investigate the signatures of a possible QGP phase transition
 and to understand the space-time evolution of the collision process in
 ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions.
 In order to accomplish this, STAR was designed primarily for measurements
 of hadron production over a large solid angle.
 The STAR detector systems are very effective in high precision tracking,
 momentum analysis, and particle identification at the central rapidity
 region.
 With the installation of the Time Of Flight detector (TOF) in 2009, STAR
 gained the capability to identify electrons and positions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
STAR has an azimuthal symmetric acceptance and covers large range around
 mid-rapidity (
\begin_inset Formula $|\eta|$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$

 azimuthal coverage).

 The subsystems involved in this analysis will be discussed in following

STAR magnet system
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The STAR magnet system (cite) is a room temperature solenoidal magnet which
 was designed as a cylinder with a length of 6.85 m and has inner and outer
 diameter of 5.27 m and 7.32 m, respectively.
 It provides an uniform magnetic field which parallels to the beam direction
 (Z direction) with a maximum value 0.5 T for charged particle momentum analysis.
 STAR magnet can work under full field (+0.5 T), reversed full field (-0.5
 T) and half field configuration (
\begin_inset Formula $\pm$
\end_inset

0.25 T).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Main tracker - Time Projection Chamber
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Time Projection Chamber (TPC) is the primary tracking detector and the
 heart of STAR detector system.
 The TPC was designed to record the tracks of particles, measure their momenta,
 and provide particle identification by measuring their ionization energy
 loss (
\emph on
dE/dx
\emph default
).
 It has a large acceptance around middle rapidity (
\begin_inset Formula $|\eta|<1.8$
\end_inset

 ) and full azimuthal coverage.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:TPC"

\end_inset

 shows the STAR TPC.
 It was built as a cylinder with a length of 4.2 m and outer diameter of
 4 m and inner diameter of 1 m.
 TPC was installed inside the STAR magnet system which provides a 0.5 T uniform
 magnetic field.
 The beam pipe which is alone the Z direction goes through the center axis
 of TPC and concentric with TPC.
 The collisions happens in side the beam pipe near the center of TPC.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inside the TPC, it is an empty volume which is filled with P10 gas (10%
 methane, 90% argon) regulated at 2 mbar above atmospheric pressure.
 There is a well defined, uniform, electric field of 
\begin_inset Formula $\thickapprox$
\end_inset

135 V/cm in the volume serve as the drift field.
 The primary advantage of P10 gas is that electrons has a fast drift velocity
 which peaks at a low electric field which makes the drift velocity stable
 and insensitive to small changes in temperature and pressure.
 The uniform drift field in TPC is defined by a thin conductive Central
 Membrane (CM) at the center of the TPC, concentric field-cage cylinders
 and the readout end caps (cite).
 The central membrane is operated at 28 kV and the end caps are at ground.
 The typical drift velocity of electrons in the STAR TPC is 5.45 cm/
\begin_inset Formula $\mu s$
\end_inset

.
 The transverse diffusion is 230 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu m/\sqrt{cm}$
\end_inset

 and the longitudinal diffusion is 360 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu m/\sqrt{cm}$
\end_inset

 with 140V/cm drift field and 0.5 T magnetic field.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The STAR TPC's readout system is based on Multi-Wire Proportional Chambers
 (MWPC) with readout pads.
 The readout planes are arranged as on a clock with 12 sectors around the
 circle at each end of TPC.
 The readout system includes four components: a pad plane and three wire
 planes, shown in FIg.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:outer_wires"

\end_inset

.
 The anode wire plane of 20 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu m$
\end_inset

 wires with the pad plane on one side and the ground wire plane on the other
 composes the amplification readout layer.
 It can provide an amplification of 1000 to 3000 while the drifting electrons
 avalanche in the high fields.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:pad_plane"

\end_inset

 shows the anode pad plane with one full sector.
 To optimize the 
\emph on
dE/dx 
\emph default
resolution, the outer sector was designed to have continuous pad coverage.
 This setup can improve statistics on the 
\emph on
dE/dx 
\emph default
measurement because the full track ionization signal is collected with more
 ionization electrons.
 The inner sub sectors are in the region of highest track density.
 The design of inner pads is optimized for good two-hit resolution by using
 smaller pads with separate pad rows instead of continuous pad coverage.
 The third wire plane is a gating grid which is a gate to control electrons
 from TPC drift volume to MWPC.
 It also stops the positive ions inside MWPC from entering the drift volume
 to preserve the uniform drift field (cite).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the charged particles travel through the gas volume, they liberate
 electrons from the gas molecules due to ionization energy loss.
 The released secondary electrons drift under the drift field to the ends
 of TPC and collected by the readout system.
 The signals then are digitalized and transmitted to STAR Data AcQuistion
 system (DAQ).
 These raw signals (ADC and TDC) are reconstructed into 3D position informations
 of the ionization (hit positions) by a Kalman filte with a typical resolution
 0.5~1.0 mm.
 The tracks of particles are reconstructed with high precision from these
 hits informations in 3 dimension by Time Projection chamber Tracker (TPT)
 algorithm.
 These tracks are combined with other available tracking detector's results
 and refit by a Kalman filter routine.
 Then the primary collision vertex is reconstructed from these global tracks.
 The primary vertex resolution is ∼ 350 μm with more than 1000 tracks.
 Furthermore, tracks with the 
\emph on
distance of closest approach
\emph default
 (dca) to the primary vertex less then 3 cm is refitted by forcing the track
 to originate from the primary vertex, these tracks are called primary tracks
 which has improved resolution in position and momentum due to the relatively
 high precision of primary vertex.
 The reconstruction efficiency including the detector acceptance for primary
 tracks depends on the particle type, track quality cuts, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{T}$
\end_inset

, track multiplicity etc.
 The typical value for the primary pions with
\begin_inset Formula $N_{fit}$
\end_inset

 > 24 and |
\begin_inset Formula $η$
\end_inset

| < 0.7, dca < 3.0 cm is approximate constant at 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{T}$
\end_inset

 > 0.4 GeV/c: 
\begin_inset Formula $>∼$
\end_inset

 90% for Au + Au peripheral collisions and ∼ 80% for central collisions,
 respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the collected ionization energy loss (
\emph on

\emph default
) information, TPC also provides capability for particle identification.
 The mean rate of
