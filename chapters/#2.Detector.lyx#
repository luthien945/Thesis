The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven Nation Laboratory
 (BNL) was built at year 1999, after nine years construction.
 It is deigned to accelerate and collide heavy ions and polarized protons
 at relativistic energy.
 RHIC has capabilities to deliver beams ranged from proton to uranium with
 high luminosity.
 The top center-of-mass collision energy is 200 GeV per nucleon pair for
 heavy ion collisions and 500 GeV for polarized p+p collisions.
 The basic design parameters of the collider are listed in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table: RHIC parameters"

\end_inset

.
 The main physics goal of RHIC is to investigate the phase transition from
 hadronic phase to QGP phase and to study the formation and property of
 QGP.
 RHIC also provides polarized p+p collision with collision energy up to
 500 GeV to expand the scientific objective of RHIC to include vigorous
 spin physics program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:RHIC overview"

\end_inset

 shows the layout of RHIC complex with the injector chain and the ring tunnel.
 The RHIC complex contains the Tandem van de Graaff pre-accelerator, a linear
 proton accelerator, the Booster Synchrotron, the Alternating Gradient Synchrotr
on (AGS) and and ultimately the RHIC synchrotron ring.
 The acceleration scenario for gold ion beams is shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig: ASfor Au"

\end_inset

.
 Negatively charged (
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{T}=-1$
\end_inset

) Au ions is injected into the Tandem Van de Graaff from the Pulsed Sputter
 Ion Source.
 They are partially stripped of their electrons and accelerated inside the
 Tandem Van de Graaff and exit with the energy of 1 MeV/nucleon and charge
 state of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{T}=+32$
\end_inset

.
 The ions are delivered to the Booster Synchrotron and accelerated to 95
 MeV/nucleon and further stripped to 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{T}=+77$
\end_inset

 at the exit.
 Then they are transferred into the AGS, where they are accelerated to 8.86
 GeV/nucleon and sorted into four final bunches.
 Ions are fully stripped (
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{T}=+79$
\end_inset

) at the exit of the AGS and transported to the RHIC storage rings though
 the AtR beamline.
 RHIC also has capability to provide polarized proton beams.
 Protons are injected from the 200 MeV Linac into the booster, followed
 by acceleration in the AGS and injection into RHIC.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
RHIC has two concentric super-conducting accelerator/storage rings, one
 (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Blue Ring
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) for clockwise and the other (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yellow Ring
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) for anti-clockwise beams.
 They are on a common horizontal plane in the tunnel with a circumference
 about 38 km.
 Each ring consists of six insertion sections with collision point at their
 center along its circumference.
 Two major experiments STAR and PHENIX are located at 6 o'clock and 8 o'clock,
 and two minor ones PHOBOS and BRAHMS were located at 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock,
 respectively.
 To date, RHIC has been configured to run in p+p, d+Au, Au+Au, Cu+Cu, Cu+Au
 and U+U collisions.

\begin_layout Section
STAR experiment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC (STAR) is one of the two large detecter systems
 constructed at RHIC.
 Heavy ion collision at RHIC creates a nuclear environment of a large produced
 particles (up to approximately 1000 per unit pseudo-rapidity) and high
 momentum particles from hard parton-parton scattering.
 The main physics goal of the STAR experiment is to measure many observables
 simultaneously to investigate the signatures of a possible QGP phase transition
 and to understand the space-time evolution of the collision process in
 ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions.
 In order to accomplish this, STAR was designed primarily for measurements
 of hadron production over a large solid angle.
 The STAR detector systems are very effective in high precision tracking,
 momentum analysis, and particle identification at the central rapidity
 region.
 With the installation of the Time Of Flight detector (TOF) in 2009, STAR
 gained the capability to identify electrons and positions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
STAR has an azimuthal symmetric acceptance and covers large range around
 mid-rapidity (
\begin_inset Formula $|\eta|$
\end_inset

<1, 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

 azimuthal coverage).
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig: STAR det"

\end_inset

 shows the layout of the STAR detector systems alone with the subsystems.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Close to the beam pipe is the Heavy Flavor Tracker (HFT) which is a new
 detector add in the STAR detector systems in 2014.
 The HFT is designed to measure the heavy flavor production by the measurement
 of displaced vertices and to do the direct topological identification of
 open charm hadrons.
 The Time Projection Chamber (TPC) is the main tracker at STAR which has
 a coverage of 
\begin_inset Formula $|\eta|$
\end_inset

<1 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

 in azimuthal direction.
 The Time Of Flight (TOF) detector is surrounding the TPC which has also
 a coverage 
\begin_inset Formula $|\eta|$
\end_inset

<1 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

 in azimuthal direction.
 The Barrel Electro-Magnetic Calorimeter (BEMC) located outside of the TOF
 and covers 
\begin_inset Formula $|\eta|<1$
\end_inset

 with complete azimuthal symmetry.
 The Endcap Electro-Magnetic Calorimeter (EEMC) covers for 1 < |η| < 2,
 over the full azimuthal range.
 The EMCs are used to distinguish high momentum single photons from photon
 pairs of π and η meson decays and electrons from charged hadrons.
 Outside the BEMC is the magnet system which provides a uniform magnetic
 field parallel to the beam direction and together with BEMC it also servers
 as the electron and hadron absorber for the Muon Telescope Detector (MTD).
 The MTD is also a new added detector, which is installed in 2014.
 It is designed to detect high 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{T}$
\end_inset

 muon for heavy flavor collectivity and production.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Along the beam pipe, there are some trigger detectors: Zero Degree Calorimeter
 (ZDC), Vertex Position Detector (VPD) and Beam-Beam Counter (BBC).
 Two ZDCs locates on each side ~ 18 m away from the collision point.
 The ZDCs are designed as hadronic calorimeters to detect the outgoing neutrons.
 Dipole magnets are put before the ZDC detectors to bend away the charged
 fragments.
 The ZDC signals are used for monitoring the heavy ion beam luminosity and
 for the experiments triggers.
 The BBC subsystem covers 
\begin_inset Formula $3.3<|\eta|<5.0$
\end_inset

 and consists of two disk shaped scintillating detectors.
 They are placed at the endcaps of the TPC (3.5 m from TPC center).
 Each BBC disk is made up of close packed hexagonal scintillator tiles in
 two rings.
 A BBC trigger corresponds to a prompt coincidence between at least one
 (out of eighteen total) tile firing in both BBC EAST and BBC WEST within
 a time window.
 This BBC trigger defines a minimum bias trigger corresponding to a p-p
 cross section of 
\begin_inset Formula $\thickapprox$
\end_inset

 26 mb, 87% of the p-p Non-Singly Diffractive (NSD) inelastic cross section.
 The VPD detector has two assembly which consists of two rings of readout
 detectors (19 channels).
 The two assemblies are mounted symmetrically with respect to the center
 of STAR at a distance of 5.7 m and cover 
\begin_inset Formula $4.24≤\eta≤5.1$
\end_inset

.
 The signals from VPD are used to select minimum bias collisions, to constrain
 the location of the primary collision vertex along the beam pipe and to
 provide start time for STAR fast timing detectors.
 EMCs is also used to trigger on high 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{T}$
\end_inset

 particle events.

The detectors involved in this analysis will be introduced in detail in
 follow sections.

STAR magnet system
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The STAR magnet system (cite) is a room temperature solenoidal magnet which
 was designed as a cylinder with a length of 6.85 m and has inner and outer
 diameter of 5.27 m and 7.32 m, respectively.
 It provides an uniform magnetic field which parallels to the beam direction
 (Z direction) with a maximum value 0.5 T for charged particle momentum analysis.
 STAR magnet can work under full field (+0.5 T), reversed full field (-0.5
 T) and half field configuration (
\begin_inset Formula $\pm$
\end_inset

0.25 T).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Main tracker - Time Projection Chamber
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Time Projection Chamber (TPC) is the primary tracking detector and the
 heart of STAR detector system.
 The TPC was designed to record the tracks of particles, measure their momenta,
 and provide particle identification by measuring their ionization energy
 loss (
\emph on
dE/dx
\emph default
).
 It has a large acceptance around middle rapidity (
\begin_inset Formula $|\eta|<1.8$
\end_inset

 ) and full azimuthal coverage.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:TPC"

\end_inset

 shows the STAR TPC.
 It was built as a cylinder with a length of 4.2 m and outer diameter of
 4 m and inner diameter of 1 m.
 TPC was installed inside the STAR magnet system which provides a 0.5 T uniform
 magnetic field.
 The beam pipe which is alone the Z direction goes through the center axis
 of TPC and concentric with TPC.
 The collisions happens in side the beam pipe near the center of TPC.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inside the TPC, it is an empty volume which is filled with P10 gas (10%
 methane, 90% argon) regulated at 2 mbar above atmospheric pressure.
 There is a well defined, uniform, electric field of 
\begin_inset Formula $\thickapprox$
\end_inset

135 V/cm in the volume serve as the drift field.
 The primary advantage of P10 gas is that electrons has a fast drift velocity
 which peaks at a low electric field which makes the drift velocity stable
 and insensitive to small changes in temperature and pressure.
 The uniform drift field in TPC is defined by a thin conductive Central
 Membrane (CM) at the center of the TPC, concentric field-cage cylinders
 and the readout end caps (cite).
 The central membrane is operated at 28 kV and the end caps are at ground.
 The typical drift velocity of electrons in the STAR TPC is 5.45 cm/
\begin_inset Formula $\mu s$
\end_inset

.
 The transverse diffusion is 230 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu m/\sqrt{cm}$
\end_inset

 and the longitudinal diffusion is 360 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu m/\sqrt{cm}$
\end_inset

 with 140V/cm drift field and 0.5 T magnetic field.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The STAR TPC's readout system is based on Multi-Wire Proportional Chambers
 (MWPC) with readout pads.
 The readout planes are arranged as on a clock with 12 sectors around the
 circle at each end of TPC.
 The readout system includes four components: a pad plane and three wire
 planes, shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:outer_wires"

\end_inset

.
 The anode wire plane of 20 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu m$
\end_inset

 wires with the pad plane on one side and the ground wire plane on the other
 composes the amplification readout layer.
 It can provide an amplification of 1000 to 3000 while the drifting electrons
 avalanche in the high fields.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:pad_plane"

\end_inset

 shows the anode pad plane with one full sector.
 To optimize the 
\emph on
dE/dx 
\emph default
resolution, the outer sector was designed to have continuous pad coverage.
 This setup can improve statistics on the 
\emph on
dE/dx 
\emph default
measurement because the full track ionization signal is collected with more
 ionization electrons.
 The inner sub sectors are in the region of highest track density.
 The design of inner pads is optimized for good two-hit resolution by using
 smaller pads with separate pad rows instead of continuous pad coverage.
 The third wire plane is a gating grid which is a gate to control electrons
 from TPC drift volume to MWPC.
 It also stops the positive ions inside MWPC from entering the drift volume
 to preserve the uniform drift field (cite).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the charged particles travel through the gas volume, they liberate
 electrons from the gas molecules due to ionization energy loss.
 The released secondary electrons drift under the drift field to the ends
 of TPC and collected by the readout system.
 The signals then are digitalized and transmitted to STAR Data AcQuistion
 system (DAQ).
 These raw signals (ADC and TDC) are reconstructed into 3D position informations
 of the ionization (hit positions) by a Kalman filte with a typical resolution
 0.5~1.0 mm.
 The tracks of particles are reconstructed with high precision from these
 hits informations in 3 dimension by Time Projection chamber Tracker (TPT)
 algorithm.
 These tracks are combined with other available tracking detector's results
 and refit by a Kalman filter routine.
 Then the primary collision vertex is reconstructed from these global tracks.
 The primary vertex resolution is ~ 350 μm with more than 1000 tracks.
 Furthermore, tracks with the 
\emph on
distance of closest approach
\emph default
 (dca) to the primary vertex less then 3 cm is refitted by forcing the track
 to originate from the primary vertex, these tracks are called primary tracks
 which has improved resolution in position and momentum due to the relatively
 high precision of primary vertex.
 The reconstruction efficiency including the detector acceptance for primary
 tracks depends on the particle type, track quality cuts, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{T}$
\end_inset

, track multiplicity etc.
 The typical value for the primary pions with 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{fit}$
\end_inset

 > 24 and |
\begin_inset Formula $η$
\end_inset

| < 0.7, dca < 3.0 cm is approximate constant at 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{T}$
\end_inset

 > 0.4 GeV/c: 
\begin_inset Formula $>∼$
\end_inset

 90% for Au + Au peripheral collisions and ~ 80% for central collisions,
 respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the collected ionization energy loss (
\emph on
dE/dx
\emph default
) information, TPC also provides capability for particle identification.
 The mean rate of 
\emph on
dE/dx 
\emph default
is given by the Bethe-Bloch equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: Bethe-Bloch"

\end_inset

 (cite):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
-\frac{dE}{dx}=Kz^{2}\frac{Z}{A}\frac{1}{\beta^{2}}\left[\frac{1}{2}\ln\frac{2m_{e}c^{2}\beta^{2}\gamma^{2}T_{max}}{I^{2}}-\beta^{2}-\frac{\delta}{2}\right]\label{eq: Bethe-Bloch}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and furthermore optimized by the Bichsel functions (cite SN0439 NIM A 562
 (2006) 154-197).
 For each track, 
\emph on
dE/dx 
\emph default
is extracted from the deposit charge collected on the pad rows up to 45.
 Energy loss of a charged particle for a given track length can be described
 by the Bichsel function (cite).
 However, the mean of the distribution is sensitive to the fluctuations
 in the tail of the distribution.
 Therefore, the most probable 
\emph on
dE/dx
\emph default
 is measured by removing the highest 30% of the measured clusters.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 shows the 70% truncated mean dE/dx distribution as well as the expectation
 from Bichsel functions.
 Clearly the energy loss is different corresponding to different particle
 species at the same momentum.
 In Au+Au 200 GeV collision, STAR can separate 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $K$

 up to ~ 0.7 GeV/c and identify proton up to ~ 1.1 GeV/c.

 The calibration is done with a specified data sample selected by following

\begin_layout Subsection
Time Of Flight system
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Time of Flight System is another important set of detectors used in
 this analysis.
 The TOF system is designed to measure the flight time of charged particles.
 Combining with path length of tracks reconstructed by TPC, it can provide
 the velocity of the charge particles which is used to identify charged
 particles.
 In Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:dEdx_Bichsel"

\end_inset

, the 
\emph on
dE/dx
\emph default
 binds of different particles cross with each other in some momentum regions
 where they can not be separated by using
\emph on
 dE/dx 
\emph default
only.
 With the installation of TOF, these holes are covered by adding the flight
 velocity into the PID criteria.
 Therefore, TOF greatly improves the PID capability of STAR and makes the
 identification of electron and position from the hadron background possible
 for the STAR detector system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The TOF consists of the barrel Time Of Flight detector (bTOF) and the the
 Vertex Position Detector (VPD).
 The bTOF is surrounding the TPC and measures the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stop
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 time (the time charged particle reach bTOF).
 The pVPD consists of two identical detector assemblies that are positioned
 very close to the beam pipe and outside the STAR magnet.
 It measures the start time (the time when the collision happens).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bTOF is based on the Multi-gap Resistive Plate Chamber (MRPC) technology
 which is first developed by the CERN ALICE group (cite).
 MRPC technology is capable to provide the necessary timing resolution with
 a relative low cost.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:MRPC"

\end_inset

 shows the side view of an MRPC module appropriate for STAR.
 Basically, the MRPC is a stack of resistive plates arranged in parallel.
 These plates are separated by nylon fishing line and form a series of uniform
 gas gaps with a width of 0.22 mm.
 The internal resistive plates are 20 cm long and 6.1 cm wide and 0.54 mm
 thick, which has a resist of 
\begin_inset Formula $8\times10^{12}\;\Omega\cdot cm$
\end_inset

.
 The external plates are 
\begin_inset Formula $20.6\; cm\times7.6\; cm\times1.1\; mm$
\end_inset

 with electrodes on the outer surface.
 High voltage is applied on these electrodes to generate a uniform strong
 electric field in each sub-gap.
 All the internal plates are electrically floating.
 When charged particles go through the chamber, they generates avalanches
 in the gas gaps.
 The resistive plates are transparent to charge induction from avalanches
 in the gaps.
 Thus the signal collected on the copper pickup pads is the sum of possible
 avalanches from all gas gaps.
 The typical size of a MRPC module is 
\begin_inset Formula $94\: mm\times212\: mm\times12\; mm$
\end_inset

 and the active area is 
\begin_inset Formula $61\; mm\times200\; mm$
\end_inset

, and has 6 readout pads which has an area of 
\begin_inset Formula $63\; mm\times31.4\; mm$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $3\; mm$
\end_inset

 gaps between pads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One TOF tray consists of 32 MRPC modules which are installed alone the beam

 Every modules contains 6 read out units (cell/channel).
 Figure

 The bTOF contains 120 trays in total and has a coverage of 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

 in azimuthal direction and 
\begin_inset Formula $|\eta|<0.9$
\end_inset

 in beam direction.
 The first prototypes of TOF were installed in year 2003.
 72% of the bTOF were installed in 2009 and fully installed with 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

 azimuthal coverage in 2010.
 The typical time resolution of TOF system is smaller than 100 ps.

STAR trigger system
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At STAR, the collision rate for Au+Au events is about 50 kHz, and for high
 luminosity p+p collisions, this rate can reach up to 4MHz which is close
 to the magnitude of the RHIC bunch crossing rate (10MHz).
 However, the STAR DAQ system can only operate at a rate below 1800Hz which
 is more than 3 magnitudes lower than the collision rate.
 Thus a trigger system is needed to reduced the event rate.
 Furthermore, only a small fraction of the collisions are physically interested.
 The beam may hit residual gas atoms in the beam pipe and also beam pipe
 itself, which makes a large fraction of the collisions are background.
 These background events should be also suppressed by the trigger system.
 The trigger system also includes triggers designed for special physics
 purpose, such like, selecting events containing high 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{T}$
\end_inset

 particles for heavy flavor and jet physics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The STAR trigger system consist of three levels.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:TriggerDataFlow"

\end_inset

 shows data flow through the trigger system.
 Level 0 examines every branch crossing to determine whether there is a
 interested interaction happened.
 It is constrained to issue a trigger decision within 1.5 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu s$
\end_inset

 after the interaction.
 The signals from fast detectors are digitized and sent into Data Storage
 and Manipulation (DSM) boards.
 The DSM boards analyze these signals and form a decision tree which is
 fead into Trigger Control Unit (TCU) board where the Level 0 trigger decision
 is issued.
 Level 1 and 2 triggers apply more complex criteria on events accepted by
 Level 0 trigger.
 Level 1 has a time budget ~ 100 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu s$
\end_inset

 and Level 2 has about 5 ms.
 When an interaction is accepted at Level 2, the trigger system notifies
 the DAQ system and detectors.
 A review on the STAR trigger system can be find at (cite).

High Level Trigger/L4 system
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The High Level Trigger (HLT) system replaced the old Level 3 trigger system
 which was abandoned since it could not catch up with STAR's DAQ system
 upgrade.
 Similar with the old Level 3 trigger system, HLT is trigger system base
 on online tracking and analysis.
 In Sec 2.2.4, we introduced the multi-level trigger system based on fast
 hardwares with simple trigger algorithms.
 It rejects most of the background events and reduce the event rate down
 to a level under STAR DAQ system limitation.
 At this points, for events selected by this trigger system, signals from
 all detectors are digitized and passed to STAR DAQ system for further processin
g.
 The HLT system is implemented after that.
 Similar as the offline event reconstruction process, it collects informations
 of subsystems from DAQ system, reconstructs events in real time, then it
 issues a trigger decision base on real time PID and analyze.
 It will select events with great physics interest, such as heavy fragmentation,
 di-electrons, exotics and UPC collisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The prototype of STAR HLT was tested in 2009 and implied in 2010.
 It worked as a tag system which tags events that pass through certain analyze
 algorithm.
 During the RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) program, it was used as an event
 monitor.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:HLT_old"

\end_inset

 shows the architecture of the HLT system used during year 2009~2012.
 It consists of two sub level, the Sector Level 3 (SL3) and the Global Level
 three (GL3).
 SL3 shares half of the computing power on 24 TPX computers, where cluster
 finding and track reconstruction are performed, sector by sector.
 After that, tracks from all sectors as well as informations from other
 subsystem are sent to GL3 machines, where they are assembled and analyzed
 to make a real time event selection.
 Currently, BEMC and TOF are included in HLT.

To keep up with the speed of DAQ system, a few techniques and approach have
 been implemented in HLT to increasing the processing speed.
 We introduced the TPC hit map to combined the calculation and correction
 for TPC hits in one step.
 It contains a grid map divided by all 24 sectors, all 45 pad rows, one
 for every 30 pads and one for every 40 time bucket.
 Points on the grid contains all the corrections the same as offline reconstruct
ion.
 Points between grids are calculated as weighted average of adjacent grids.
 With the TPC hit map, the CPU time of hits reconstruction is reduced from
 ~ 1 s per event to ~20 ms per event.
 Tracking reconstruction in HLT is done sector by sector in parallel, so
 24 times of speed-up is naturally achieved.
 The STAR HLT tracker is based on conformal mapping (cite) and a follow-your-nos
e approach on finding next-hit-on-track.
 These approaches greatly reduces the track time with little loss on efficiency
 and track resolution (at 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{T}$
\end_inset

>1 GeV/c efficiency w.r.t offline is 90% and momentum difference w.r.t offline
 is less than 2%).
 The TOF and BEMC calibration tables for HLT was made following the same
 procedure as offline.
 The EMC pedestal and gain table are the same as the one used by STAR's
 lower level triggers.
 The TPC 
\emph on
dE/dx 
\emph default
calibration is made by adjusting the 
\emph on

\emph default
gain obtained from the previous run, for inner and outer sector separately.
 The calibration for TPC hit positions are folded into the TPC hit map
