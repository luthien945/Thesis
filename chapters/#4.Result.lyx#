 shows the dielectron invariant mass spectra from 200 GeV p+p collisions
 taken in year 2012.
 The cocktail is taken from the STAR published result (cite), and the charm

 with respect to the newest published result from STAR (cite).
 The cocktail simulation can reproduce the new preliminary result very well.
 With a full TOF coverage and more data taken, year 2012 result has greatly
 improved statistics which is ~7 times more than STAR published result (cite).
 The large statistics new results at p+p 200 GeV provide a better baseline
 for Au+Au collisions.

\begin_layout Section
Di-electron production in Au+Au Collisions at 200 GeV at STAR
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we report the results from Au+Au collision at 200 GeV.
 The results are taken from the combined year 2010 and year 2011 data (as
 described in Sec.
 3.8).
 The dielectron signals were obtained as described in Sec.
 3.4.5.
 The dielectron yields were corrected for the dielectron reconstruction
 efficiency.
 All the results were measured in the STAR acceptance (
\begin_inset Formula $p_{T}^{e}>0.2\, GeV/c$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $|\eta^{e}|<1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $|y_{ee}|<1$

.
 The data are compared to the hadronic cocktail simulations without the
 vacuum 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 contribution.
 The ratios of data over cocktail simulations are shown in the bottom panels.
 The green band around unity indicated the uncertainties on the cocktail
 calculations, which are mainly determined by the uncertainties on the 
\begin_inset Formula $dN/dy$
\end_inset

 and decay branching ratios for each individual source as discussed in Sec
 3.6.
 We consider 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 mesons are strongly coupled with the medium in Au+Au collisions, thus we
 don't include it in default hadronic cocktail calculations.
 We left its contribution to the theory model calculations which will be
 discussed in following subsections.
 The correlated charm contribution as described in Sec 3.6 is taken from
 PYTHIA simulation and scaled by the number of binary collisions (
\begin_inset Formula $N_{{\rm bin}}$
\end_inset

).

\begin_layout Standard
In the LMR region, an enhancement of 
\begin_inset Formula $1.66\pm0.06(stat.)\pm0.24(sys.)\pm0.41(cocktail)$
\end_inset

 is observed with respect to the cocktail without vacuum 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 contribution in the mass region of 0.3~0.76 GeV/
\begin_inset Formula $c^{2}$
\end_inset

, when comparing the measured data points to the hadronic cocktail.
 The enhancement cannot be fully explained by the expected vacuum 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 contribution.
 The enhancement observed here is significantly lower than what has been
 reported from the dielectron measurement from PHENIX experiment (cite).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the IMR region, the cocktail is dominant with the contribution from correlate
d charm pair decays based on PYTHIA simulations.
 The cocktail simulations can generally describe the data points reasonably
 well within uncertainty, although the data seem to sit a bit higher then
 the expected cocktail contribution, leaving some room for contributions
 from other sources.
 However, the uncertainties on data points and cocktail are large which
 makes it impossible to distinguish any other contributions if it is there.
 The current uncertainty on the charm production cross section 
\begin_inset Formula $d\sigma^{c\bar{c}}/dy$
\end_inset

 at mid-rapidity which meed to be used for normalization is around 40%.
 More precise measurements on both the total charm cross section as well
 as the correlation in Au+Au collisions are needed to conclude any other
 source contribution, such as QGP thermal radiation, in this mass region.

\begin_layout Subsection
Comparison to models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Restoration of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry will lead to modificatio
n to the vector meson (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 meson in the leading role) spectral functions, which are accessible via
 dilepton measurements in heavy ion collisions.
 Thus, studying the chiral symmetry properties of the QCD medium created
 in heavy ion collisions is one of the major motivations of dilepton production
 measurements.
 There are two scenarios commonly used to address the effect due to the
 chiral symmetry restoration: (a) drop of the pole mass or degeneracy of
 vector and axial-vector mesons due to the reduced 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle q\bar{q}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 condensate (cite PRC [8]).
 (b) broadening of the spectral function due to mean body collisions in
 the vector-meson dominance (cite PRC [9,43]).
 Both scenarios will introduce an enhancement in the mass region below the
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 mass compared to the spectral function in vacuum.
 High precision data from NA60 suggested that the enhancement in the low
 mass dilepton spectrum is consistent with in-medium broadening of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 spectral function instead of a dropping of its pole mass hypothesis at
 the SPS energy (cite).
 It is expected that the hadronic medium at top RHIC energy is similar to
 that created at the SPS energy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The QGP contribution to dileptons has been often calculated perturbatively
 via the Born 
\begin_inset Formula $q+\bar{q}$
\end_inset

 annihilation at the leading order.
 Various approached have been studied to take into account high order contributi
ons at the finite 
\begin_inset Formula $T-\mu_{B}$
\end_inset

 environment (cite PRC [44]).
 The QGP contribution is expected to become sizable at 
\begin_inset Formula $M>1.5\, GeV/c^{2}$
\end_inset

 at the top RHIC energy due to the well established partonic phase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There have been many theory calculations for the dielectron production at
 RHIC.
 We chosen two theory calculations from different groups to compare with
 out data: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
\emph on
Model I: from Rapp's group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We chose one model calculation from Rapp (cite PRC [46]), which is a 
\emph on
macroscopic effective many-body theory model
\emph default
.
 In this model, dilepton production in the hadronic medium is calculated
 via electromagnetic correlators based on the Vector-meson Dominance Model
 (VDM) approach.
 This model assumes that the hadronic medium reaches thermal equilibrated.
 Therefore, the dilepton rates are determined by the 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 meson propagetor in this medium, which depends on the interactions of the
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 with mesons and baryons in this medium at finite 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{B}$
\end_inset

.
 The calculation results shows the resulting broadened 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 spectral function is mostly due to the interactions with baryons rather
 than mesons (cite PRC[45,47,48]).
 Thus total baryon density of the medium is one critical factor in determining
 the dielectron yield in heavy ion collisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The QGP contribution is calculated via perturbative 
\begin_inset Formula $q\bar{q}$
\end_inset

 annihilation with some improved corrections.
 It has beed demonstrated in these calculations the dilepton rates from
 the hadronic medium and from partonic medium should be equivalent at 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{c}$
\end_inset

, which is called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

parton-hadron
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 duality (cite PRC [45]).
 The final resulting dielectron yields from observation are calculated via
 the integral over the whole space-time evolution for this medium.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
\emph on
Model II: Parton-Hadron String Dynamic (PHSD) 
\emph default
transport model
\series default
\emph on
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The PHSD model is a 
\emph on
microscopic transport dynamic model.
 
\emph default
It is consisted of the off-shell evaluation of vector mesons and the explicit
 partonic phase contributions in the early stage of the medium evaluation
 as well as the dynamics of hadronization (cite PRC[49]).
 The model allows for a microscopic study of various dilepton production
 channels in non-equilibriumous medium.
 In the hadronic sector, the PHSD is equivalent to the HSD transport approach
 that has been used for the description of pA and AA collisions from SIS
 to RHIC energies.
 It fairly reproduces the measured hadron yields, rapidity distributions
 and transverse momentum spectra (cite PRC[50]).
 The PHSD model incorporates off-shell dynamics for vector mesons and a
 set of vector-meson spectral functions that covers possible scenarios for
 their in-medium modifications.
 In the scope of the one- and two-particle interactions, dilepton radiation
 by the constituents of the strongly interacting QGP proceeds via following
 elementary processes: the basic Born 
\begin_inset Formula $q+\bar{q}$
\end_inset

 annihilation mechanism, gluon Compton scattering (
\begin_inset Formula $q(\bar{q})+g\rightarrow\gamma^{*}+q(\bar{q})$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $ $
\end_inset

) and quark and anti-quark annihilation with the gluon Bremsstrahlung in
 the final state (
\begin_inset Formula $q+\bar{q}\rightarrow g+\gamma^{*}$
\end_inset

).
 Dilepton production in these partonic channels is calculated with off-shell
 partons using the phenomenological parametrizations for the quark and gluon
 propagators and their interaction strength in QGP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the LMR (
\begin_inset Formula $M_{ee}$
\end_inset

<1.1 GeV/
\begin_inset Formula $c^{2}$
\end_inset

), the comparison is focused on model calculations with different hadronic
 medium modification scenarios for 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 mesons (Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:LowMass_Rapp"

\end_inset

): no modification vacuum 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 contribution (left panel) and in-medium 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 with broadening mass spectral function (middle panel).
 The QGP radiation contributions are also included in comparison.
 The comparison with PHSD model is also shown (right panel).
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:excess-1"

\end_inset

 provides a more clearly view by comparing these model calculation with
 the dielectron excess spectra (data subtracted with the default cocktail).
 The grey bars depict the systematic uncertainties from data analysis, while
 the green brackets depict the total systematic uncertainties including
 those from data and cocktail.
 Considering the highly correlated systematic errors across all data points,
 we utilized the modified 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

-test (see Appendix A) to quantify the consistency between data and model
 calculations, the results are summarized in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Table:chi-test_excess"

\end_inset

.
 From the 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

-test, the vacuum 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 + QGP scenario in Rapp's implementation is cleared ruled out by our data.
 The calculations including the broadened 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 scenario + QGP contribution from both Rapp and PHSD show reasonable agreements
 to our data, and the Rapp's calculation is more favored.
 The correlated charm also has a sizable contributions starting from 0.5
 GeV/
\begin_inset Formula $c^{2}$
\end_inset

, while our cocktail still 
\begin_inset Formula $ $
\end_inset

uses the 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{{\rm bin}}$
\end_inset

 scaled correlated charm contribution from PYTHIA simulation.
 Therefore precision knowledge of correlated charm contribution in heavy
 ion collision will provide further improvement on distinguish between different
 scenarios .

\begin_layout Plain Layout
(a) Dielectron invariant mass spectra from minimum bias (0-80%) and central
 (0- 10%) collisions.
 The spectra are scaled by the number of participant nucleons (
\begin_inset Formula $N_{part}$
\end_inset

).
 The solid line represents the hadronic cocktail for central collisions.
 The dashed line depicts the correlated charm from PYTHIA, while the dot-dashed
 line assumes a fully randomized azimuthal correlation between charm pairs
 and the 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{T}$
\end_inset

 suppression factor on single electron spectrum from RHIC is also included
 (cite).
 (b) The ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{part}$
\end_inset

 scaled dielectron yields between the central and minimum bias collisions.
 Systematic uncertainties are shown as the grey box.
