\begin_layout Standard
The Standard Model of particle physics is a theory concerning the electromagneti
c, weak, and strong nuclear interactions, which explains how the basic building
 blocks of matter interact.
 The Standard Model includes members of several classes of elementary particles:
 12 elementary particles of spin 1/2 known as fermions, 4 gauge bosons of
 spin 1 who carry the force of fundamental interactions and Higgs boson
 of spin 0 which interacts with elementary particles and gives them mass.
 The 12 fermions includes 6 quarks (up (
\emph on
u
\emph default
), down (
\emph on
d
\emph default
), strange (
\emph on
s
\emph default
), charm (
\emph on
c
\emph default
), top (
\emph on
t
\emph default
), bottom (
\emph on

)), and 6 leptons (electron (
\emph on
e
\emph default
), muon (
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

), tau (
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

) and the corresponding neutrinos).
 The 4 gauge bosons are gluon (
\emph on
g
\emph default
), photon (
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

), 
\emph on
W
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
Z
\emph default
 bosons, which are classified by the fundamental force they carry.
 Gluons mediate the strong interactions between color charged particles
 (quarks).
 Gluons also carry color charge, so they can also interact with themselves.
 The strong interaction are described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics.
 The electric charged particles interact through the electromagnetic force
 mediated by Photons which is well-described by the theory of quantum electrodyn
amics.
 The weak force is carried by 
\emph on
W
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
Z
\emph default
 bosons.
 They are grouped with photons, as collectively mediation the electroweak
 interaction.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows the particles generations and interactions between them.
 Fermions interact with each other through the fundamental force carried
 by gauge bosons and form the matter world.
 On 14 March 2013, the Higgs boson was tentatively confirmed to exist.

\begin_layout Subsection
Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the 1950s, a large number of strongly interacting particles (hadrons)
 were discovered in particle physics experiments.
 To understand and explained the spectrum of these particles, in 1963, Gell-Mann
 and Zweig proposed a model in terms of elementary constituents called 
\emph on
quarks.
 
\emph default
The hadrons could be sorted into groups having similar quantum properties
 by the existence of three flavors of quarks inside hadrons.
 Mesons were expected to be quark-antiquark bound states, while baryons
 were interpreted as bound states of three quarks.
 To explain the electric charges and other quantum numbers of hadrons, Gell-Mann
 and Zweig assumed three species of quarks, up (
\emph on
u
\emph default
), down (
\emph on
d
\emph default
) and strange (
\emph on
s
\emph default
).
 With the discovery of more hadrons, the quarks family were extended of
 three more species: charm (
\emph on
c
\emph default
), bottom (
\emph on
b
\emph default
) and top (
\emph on
t
\emph default
).
 To make baryons with integer charges, the quarks were assigned fractional
 electric charge: +2/3 for 
\emph on
u
\emph default
, 
\emph on
c, t, 
\emph default
and -1/3 for 
\emph on
d
\emph default
, 
\emph on
s
\emph default
, 
\emph on
b.
 
\emph default
And all quarks were assumed to be spin-1/2.
 The quark model had great success in predicting new hadronic states, but
 some hadrons composed with three identical quarks with parallel spin, such
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\varDelta^{++}$
\end_inset

(
\emph on
uuu
\emph default
), are forbidden by the Pauli exclusion principle.
 To solve this problem, Han and Nambu, Greenberg, and Gell-Mann introduced
 an additional SU(3) gauge degree of freedom of quarks called 
\emph on
color 
\emph default
and an octet of vector gauge bosons called gluons to carry the interaction
 between quarks.
 In 1972, Gell-Man and Fritzsch introduced the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)
 to describe the strong interaction between the colored quarks and gluons.

The QCD Lagrangian can be written as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L_{{\rm QCD}}}=-\frac{1}{4}F_{a}^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}^{a}+\underset{f}{\sum}\bar{q_{f}}^{i}i\gamma^{\mu}(D_{\mu})_{ij}q_{f}^{j}-\underset{f}{\sum}m_{f}\bar{q}_{f}^{i}q_{f}^{i}\label{eq:LQCD}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F_{a}^{\mu\nu}=\partial^{\mu}G_{a}^{\nu}-\partial^{\nu}G_{a}^{\mu}+g_{s}f^{abc}G_{b}^{\mu}G_{c}^{\nu}\label{eq:fieldStr}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
D^{\mu}=\partial^{\mu}-ig_{s}\frac{\lambda^{a}}{2}G_{a}^{\mu}\label{eq:cd}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{s}$
\end_inset

 is the QCD coupling constant, and the 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{abc}$
\end_inset

 are the structure constants of the 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(3)_{C}$

 algebra.
 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{f}^{i}$
\end_inset

 defines a quark field with color 
\emph on

 and flavor 
\emph on

\emph default
, while 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 are the Dirac matrices.
 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{a}^{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 are the field strengths tensor which were introduced to describe the self
 interaction of the gluon fields.
 
\begin_inset Formula $D^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 are the covariant derivative with the Gell-Mann matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda^{a}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Running coupling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effective QCD coupling constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{s}(\mu)$
\end_inset

 can be written as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\alpha_{s}(\mu)\equiv\frac{g_{s}^{2}(\mu)}{4\pi}\approx\frac{4\pi}{\beta_{0}\ln(\mu^{2}/\Lambda_{QCD}^{2})}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}$
\end_inset

 is a constant larger than 0 which dependence on the number of quarks with
 mass less than the energy scale 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

.
 The coupling 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{s}(\mu)$
\end_inset

 shows a dependence on the renormalization scale.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{s}$

\emph default
The world average result of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{s}(M_{z}^{2})=0.1179\pm0.0008$
\end_inset

 (cite) and the QCD scale is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{QCD}$
\end_inset

~200 MeV.
 With decreasing interaction distance and increasing momentum transfer,
 the coupling constant decreases, the interaction between quarks and gluons
 goes weaker.
 This is the major feature of QCD: asymptotic freedom.
 While the energy scale 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\ll\Lambda_{QCD}$
\end_inset

 (short distance and high momentum transfer), QCD can be described with
 perturbative method (perturbative QCD).
 On the other hand, pQCD breaks down when the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\sim\Lambda_{QCD}$
\end_inset

 where QCD becomes strongly coupled.
 People introduced Lattice QCD to calculated QCD in this case.

\begin_layout Subsection
Chiral symmetry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We consider the Lagrangian of two flavors massless fermions, and the results
 will be directly applicable to massless QCD.
 The Lagrangian is given by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}=i\bar{\psi_{j}}\gamma_{\mu}\partial^{\mu}\psi_{j}\label{eq:L_massless}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the index 
\emph on
j 
\emph default
presents the two different flavors (
\emph on
u
\emph default
, 
\emph on
d
\emph default
).
 Consider two transformation :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
vector transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{V}$
\end_inset

 :
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Lambda_{V}:\;\psi\rightarrow e^{-i\frac{\vec{\tau}}{2}\vec{\Theta}}\psi\simeq(1-i\frac{\vec{\tau}}{2}\vec{\Theta})\psi
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and its conjugate form:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Lambda_{V}:\;\bar{\psi}\rightarrow e^{+i\frac{\vec{\tau}}{2}\vec{\Theta}}\bar{\psi}\simeq(1+i\frac{\vec{\tau}}{2}\vec{\Theta})\bar{\psi}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{\tau}$
\end_inset

 is the Pauli-spin-matrices and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{\Theta}$
\end_inset

 are the rotation angle.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is the Dirac iso-spinor for fermions, 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=(\psi_{u},\psi_{d})$
\end_inset

.
 Clearly the Lagrangian is invariant under 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{V}$
\end_inset

 and the associated conserved current is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
V_{\mu}^{a}=\bar{\psi}\gamma_{\mu}\frac{\tau^{a}}{2}\psi
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
axial transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{A}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\Lambda_{A}:\;\psi & \rightarrow e^{-i\gamma_{5}\frac{\vec{\tau}}{2}\vec{\Theta}}\psi\simeq(1-i\gamma_{5}\frac{\vec{\tau}}{2}\vec{\Theta})\psi\\
\bar{\psi} & \rightarrow e^{-i\gamma_{5}\frac{\vec{\tau}}{2}\vec{\Theta}}\bar{\psi}\simeq(1-i\gamma_{5}\frac{\vec{\tau}}{2}\vec{\Theta})\bar{\psi}
\end{align}

\end_inset

The Lagrangian transforms as following :
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
i\bar{\psi}\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\psi\rightarrow i\bar{\psi}\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\psi-i\vec{\Theta}(\bar{\psi}i\partial_{\mu}\gamma^{\mu}\gamma_{5}\frac{\vec{\tau}}{2}\psi+\bar{\psi}\gamma_{5}\frac{\vec{\tau}}{2}i\partial_{\mu}\gamma^{\mu}\psi)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

since 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{5}$
\end_inset

 anti-commutes with 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{\mu}$
\end_inset

, the last term vanishes.
 Therefore the Lagrangian is also invariant under 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{A}$
\end_inset

 with the conserved 'axial-vector' current: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
A_{\mu}^{a}=\bar{\psi}\gamma_{\mu}\gamma_{5}\frac{\tau^{a}}{2}\psi
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, the Lagrangian of massless QCD is invariant under the vector and axial
 transformations.
 This symmetry is called 
\emph on
chiral symmetry
\emph default
.
 If we introduce a mass term in the Lagrangian.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta\mathcal{L}=-m(\bar{\psi}\psi)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

It can easily prove the 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

 is invariant under the vector transformations, but the axial transformations
 symmetry is broken.
 In case of QCD, the mass of the light quarks are very small (about 5~10
 MeV) comparing to the QCD energy scale which is about 200 MeV.
 Therefore, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{A}$
\end_inset

 should be an approximate symmetry.
 And the slight symmetry breaking due to the quark masses is called Partial
 Conserved Axial Current hypothesis (PCAC).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conservation of chiral symmetry leads to a direct deduction that the
 chiral partner which can be rotated into each other by the operation 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{A}$
\end_inset

 should have the same masses, since they should have the same Eigenvalues.
 However, in the real world, this is clearly not true, since the chiral
 partner 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}$
\end_inset

 have quite difference masses (
\begin_inset Formula $m_{\rho}=770$
\end_inset

 MeV and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{a_{1}}=1260$
\end_inset

 MeV) which should be degenerate if the chiral symmetry is conserved.
 In additional, this can not be explained by the slight symmetry breaking
 due to the finite current quark masses, which should lead to a mass difference
 much smaller than the particle mass.
 However, the mass difference between 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}$
\end_inset

 is of the same order as 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 mass.
 On the other hand, let us consider the weak decay of pion which is controlled
 by the matrix element of the axial current between vacuum and pion 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle 0|A_{\mu}^{a}(x)|\pi^{b}(q)\right\rangle =-if_{\pi}q_{\mu}\delta^{ab}e^{-iq\cdot x}\label{eq:pi_wd}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{\pi}$
\end_inset

 is a constant ~ 93 MeV which measures the strength of the symmetry breaking.
 If we take the divergence of eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:pi_wd"

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle 0|\partial^{\mu}A_{\mu}^{a}(x)|\pi^{b}(q)\right\rangle =-if_{\pi}q_{\mu}q^{\mu}\delta^{ab}e^{-iq\cdot x}=-f_{\pi}m_{\pi}^{2}\delta^{ab}e^{-iq\cdot x}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

, comparing to the hadronic scales, the pion mass is vanishing, thus the
 axial current is approximately conserved which supports for the conservation
 of chiral symmetry.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To solve the contradiction discussed above, the spontaneous breakdown of
 chiral symmetry was introduced.
 The breaking of symmetry has two conditions: explicit breaking, which is
 due to the explicit asymmetry in the Lagrangian, i.e.
 the finite mass of quarks in QCD; spontaneous breaking, which means the
 symmetry is not realized in the ground state.
 We considering effective potentials shown in fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:sbsc"

\end_inset

.
 Panel (a) shows a potential with ground state just in the middle.
 The ground state plus potential are invariant under rotations.
 In panel (b), any points in the valley can be the ground state.
 If we chosen as one direction as the ground state, the axial rotation symmetry
 is obviously spontaneously broken, since the Lagrangian is invariant but
 the vacuum is not.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The QCD vacuum of quark-antiquark condensate 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle 0\left|\bar{q}q\right|0\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 can be related to 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{\pi}$
\end_inset

 by the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation (GOR):
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
m_{\pi}^{2}f_{\pi}^{2}=-2\bar{m}\left\langle 0\left|\bar{q}q\right|0\right\rangle 
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{m}$
\end_inset

 is the average mass of up and down quarks.
 If taking 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{m}$
\end_inset

 = 6 MeV, then the vacuum of quark antiquark condensate is about 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle 0\left|\bar{q}q\right|0\right\rangle \approx(-250MeV)^{3}$
\end_inset

.
 The non-zero vacuum spontaneously breaks the chiral symmetry of QCD.
 Since chiral symmetry is a global symmetry, its spontaneous breaking must
 be accompanied by (almost) massless Goldstone bosons.
 In case of two quark flavors, the three charge states of the pion servers
 as the Goldstone bosons, with a mass (about 140 MeV) which is much smaller
 comparing to all the other hadrons.
 The assumption of spontaneously broken axial-vector symmetry also explains
 the large mass splitting between 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}$
\end_inset

 meson.
 Theory calculations predict that 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{a_{1}}=\sqrt{2}m_{\rho}$

\begin_layout Standard
Another important feature of QCD is confinement which lead to the absence
 of direct observation of isolated quarks and gluons in the experiment.
 The confinement is because gluons who carry the force have color charge
 and thus can interact with itself.
 Due to the property of the running QCD coupling constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{s}$
\end_inset

, when two quarks are separated from each other, the force between them
 grows stronger as the distance increasing.
 When the energy is enough, a new quark/anti-quark pair is created from
 the vacuum.
 As result of this, the quarks and gluons are confined inside hadrons, and
 when quarks is created in high energy experiment, instead of seeing the
 individual quarks, only cluster of color neutral hadrons are observed.
 This process is called hadronization.
 On the other hand, when the system is at extreme temperature or high energy
 density, such like the universe in a few microsecond after the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Big Bang
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, due to the asymptotic freedom, the interaction between partons (quarks/anti-qu
arks and gluons) is very weak and the partons can travel over larger distances
 of the size of a nucleon (~1 fm).
 The quarks and gluons are deconfined and form a thermalized state known
 as Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP)

 However, the locations of the phase boundary and the critical point in
 this framework depend on model assumptions.
 One of the main aim of high-energy heavy-ion collision experiments is to
 explore the QCD phase diagram, to locate the position of critical point,
 and to determine the QCD phase boundary.

Dilepton production in high energy heavy ion collisions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The heavy ion collision is believed to be the best way to study properties
 of QCD matter in laboratory, since increasing the mass number of the incident
 particles is more efficient than increasing beam energy.
 During the past 20 years, world wide effort has been dedicated in this
 region.
 Several large-scale experiments have been conducted.
 Relativistic heavy ion collider (RHIC) built in Brookhaven National Laboratory
 is the first accelerator-collider dedicated to heavy ion collisions.
 During the first few years of its operation, plenty measurements support
 the existence of a new matter form: a strongly coupling Quark Gluon Plasma
 (sQGP).
 Currently the physics program at RHIC was changing to studying the property
 of strongly interacting matter created in high energy heavy ion collisions
 and searching for phase boundary and critical point of the QGP phase diagram.
 At CERN, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) also contributes in the heavy
 ion collisions program.
 It is pushing the colliding energy up to 5.5 TeV, where the energy density
 and temperature is much higher than the requirement of QGP formation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Probes explored in experiments are mostly hadrons which have been used to
 demonstrate the formation of a strongly-coupled Quark Gluon Plasma (sQGP)
 in high energy heavy ion collision at RHIC and LHC.
 Dileptons as an electromagnetic probe, escape the interacting system without
 suffering further strong interactions after production.
 In additional, dilepton can be produced on the various stages of entire
 system evolution.
 They are therefore expected to be an outstanding probes to study the property
 of the medium created in high energy heavy ion collisions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Traditionally, due to different physics of interest, the dilepton kinematic
 phase space is divided into the Low Mass Region - LMR (
\begin_inset Formula $M_{ll}<M_{\phi}$
\end_inset

), the Intermediate Mass Region - IMR (
\begin_inset Formula $M_{\phi}<M_{ll}<M_{J/\psi}$
\end_inset

) and the High Mass Region - HMR (
\begin_inset Formula $M_{ll}>M_{J/\psi}$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the initial stage of the system, the initial hard pQCD process Drell-Yan
 production (
\begin_inset Formula $q\bar{q}\rightarrow l^{+}l^{-}$
\end_inset

) can produce high mass dilepton and is thus expected to dominate in the
 HMR.
 Moreover, direct photons form the initial hard scattering can allow for
 bremsstrahlung emission of soft virtual photons which convert into low
 mass and high transverse momentum (
\begin_inset Formula $p_{T}$
\end_inset

) dielectrons (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

internal conversion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 These dilepton, in principle, can be calculated within the pQCD frame.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system is expected to quickly reach the partonic sQGP phase where dileptons
 can be produced in thermal radiation via multiple parton-parton scattering.
 Theoretical calculations suggest that at top RHIC energy, QGP thermal dilepton
 production will become dominant in the IMR while thermal dileptons with
 higher masses originate from earlier stages

.
 This indicates that investigating the thermal dilepton production in 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{ll}$
\end_inset

 & 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{T}$
\end_inset

 allows for probing the medium properties at different stages of the space-time
 evolution.
 Measuring thermal dilepton collective flow and polarization can reveal
 information about the degrees of freedom of deconfinement and equilibrium
 of the strongly interacting matter created in heavy ion collisions

 Thermal radiation can produce real photons accompanied by low mass and
 high 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{T}$
\end_inset

 dileptons.
 Study of these dileptons compared to that from initial hard scattering,
 one can learn the direct real photon production from the thermal QGP medium.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the system expands, cools and enters into the hadronic phase, dileptons
 are produced via multiple hadron-hadron scattering by coupling to vector
 mesons (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho,\:\omega,\:\phi$
\end_inset

 etc).
 They are expected do dominate the LMR dielectron production

.
 Their mass spectra are correlated to the chiral properties of the medium
 which is spontaneously broken in vacuum.
 Theoretical calculations suggest that the vector meson spectral functions
 will be modified in the hot and dense hadronic medium, which may be connected
 to the restoration of chiral symmetry.
 Two scenarios have been proposed for the change of vector meson spectral
 functions when chiral symmetry is restored: a shift of the pole mass

 and a broadening of the mass spectral function

 The

 hadronic medium (~ 10 fm).
 Measurements of dielectron continuum in the low mass region will shed light
 on the vector meson production mechanism, and hence the medium chiral propertie
s in heavy ion collisions.

 Their contributions can be calculated based on the measured or predicted
 invariant yields of parent mesons.
 Usually, their contributions are called hadronic decay cocktail.
