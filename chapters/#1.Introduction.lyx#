Standard model and Quantum Chromodynamics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Standard Model of particle physics is a theory concerning the electromagneti
c, weak, and strong nuclear interactions, which explains how the basic building
 blocks of matter interact.
 The Standard Model includes members of several classes of elementary particles:
 12 elementary particles of spin 1/2 known as fermions, 4 gauge bosons of
 spin 1 who carry the force of fundamental interactions and Higgs boson
 of spin 0 which interacts with elementary particles and gives them mass.
 The 12 fermions includes 6 quarks (up (
\emph on
u
\emph default
), down (
\emph on
d
\emph default
), strange (
\emph on
s
\emph default
), charm (
\emph on
c
\emph default
), top (
\emph on
t
\emph default
), bottom (
\emph on
b
\emph default
)), and 6 leptons (electron (
\emph on
e
\emph default
), muon (
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

), tau (
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

) and the corresponding neutrinos).
 The 4 gauge bosons are gluon (
\emph on
g
\emph default
), photon (
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

), 
\emph on
W
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
Z
\emph default
 bosons, which are classified by the fundamental force they carry.
 Gluons mediate the strong interactions between color charged particles
 (quarks).
 Gluons also carry color charge, so they can also interact with themselves.
 The strong interaction are described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics.
 The electric charged particles interact through the electromagnetic force
 mediated by Photons which is well-described by the theory of quantum electrodyn
amics.
 The weak force is carried by 
\emph on
W
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
Z
\emph default
 bosons.
 They are grouped with photons, as collectively mediation the electroweak
 interaction.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows the particles generations and interactions between them.
 Fermions interact with each other through the fundamental force carried
 by gauge bosons and form the matter world.
 On 14 March 2013, the Higgs boson was tentatively confirmed to exist.

\begin_layout Subsection
Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the 1950s, a large number of strongly interacting particles (hadrons)
 were discovered in particle physics experiments.
 To understand and explained the spectrum of these particles, in 1963, Gell-Mann
 and Zweig proposed a model in terms of elementary constituents called 
\emph on
quarks.
 
\emph default
The hadrons could be sorted into groups having similar quantum properties
 by the existence of three flavors of quarks inside hadrons.
 Mesons were expected to be quark-antiquark bound states, while baryons
 were interpreted as bound states of three quarks.
 To explain the electric charges and other quantum numbers of hadrons, Gell-Mann
 and Zweig assumed three species of quarks, up (
\emph on
u
\emph default
), down (
\emph on
d
\emph default
) and strange (
\emph on
s
\emph default
).
 With the discovery of more hadrons, the quarks family were extended of
 three more species: charm (
\emph on
c
\emph default
), bottom (
\emph on
b
\emph default
) and top (
\emph on
t
\emph default
).
 To make baryons with integer charges, the quarks were assigned fractional
 electric charge: +2/3 for 
\emph on
u
\emph default
, 
\emph on
c, t, 
\emph default
and -1/3 for 
\emph on
d
\emph default
, 
\emph on
s
\emph default
, 
\emph on
b.
 
\emph default
And all quarks were assumed to be spin-1/2.
 The quark model had great success in predicting new hadronic states, but
 some hadrons composed with three identical quarks with parallel spin, such
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\varDelta^{++}$
\end_inset

(
\emph on
uuu
\emph default
), are forbidden by the Pauli exclusion principle.
 To solve this problem, Han and Nambu, Greenberg, and Gell-Mann introduced
 an additional SU(3) gauge degree of freedom of quarks called 
\emph on
color 
\emph default
and an octet of vector gauge bosons called gluons to carry the interaction
 between quarks.
 In 1972, Gell-Man and Fritzsch introduced the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)
 to describe the strong interaction between the colored quarks and gluons.

The QCD Lagrangian can be written as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L_{{\rm QCD}}}=-\frac{1}{4}F_{a}^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}^{a}+\underset{f}{\sum}\bar{q_{f}}^{i}i\gamma^{\mu}(D_{\mu})_{ij}q_{f}^{j}-\underset{f}{\sum}m_{f}\bar{q}_{f}^{i}q_{f}^{i}\label{eq:LQCD}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F_{a}^{\mu\nu}=\partial^{\mu}G_{a}^{\nu}-\partial^{\nu}G_{a}^{\mu}+g_{s}f^{abc}G_{b}^{\mu}G_{c}^{\nu}\label{eq:fieldStr}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
D^{\mu}=\partial^{\mu}-ig_{s}\frac{\lambda^{a}}{2}G_{a}^{\mu}\label{eq:cd}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{s}$
\end_inset

 is the QCD coupling constant, and the 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{abc}$
\end_inset

 are the structure constants of the 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(3)_{C}$
\end_inset

 algebra.
 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{f}^{i}$
\end_inset

 defines a quark field with color 
\emph on

\emph default
 and flavor 
\emph on
f 
\emph default
, while 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 are the Dirac matrices.
 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{a}^{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 are the field strengths tensor which were introduced to describe the self
 interaction of the gluon fields.
 
\begin_inset Formula $D^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 are the covariant derivative with the Gell-Mann matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda^{a}$
\end_inset

 and the Yang-Mills (gluon) fields 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{\mu}^{a}(x)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $a=$
\end_inset

1, 2, ..., 8.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Running coupling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effective QCD coupling constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{s}(\mu)$
\end_inset

 can be written as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\alpha_{s}(\mu)\equiv\frac{g_{s}^{2}(\mu)}{4\pi}\approx\frac{4\pi}{\beta_{0}\ln(\mu^{2}/\Lambda_{QCD}^{2})}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}$
\end_inset

 is a constant larger than 0 which dependence on the number of quarks with
 mass less than the energy scale 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

.
 The coupling 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{s}(\mu)$
\end_inset

 shows a dependence on the renormalization scale.
 Figure

\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{s}$

\emph default
The world average result of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{s}(M_{z}^{2})=0.1179\pm0.0008$
\end_inset

 (cite) and the QCD scale is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{QCD}$
\end_inset

~200 MeV.
 With decreasing interaction distance and increasing momentum transfer,
 the coupling constant decreases, the interaction between quarks and gluons
 goes weaker.
 This is the major feature of QCD: asymptotic freedom.
 While the energy scale 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\ll\Lambda_{QCD}$
\end_inset

 (short distance and high momentum transfer), QCD can be described with
 perturbative method (perturbative QCD).
 On the other hand, pQCD breaks down when the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\sim\Lambda_{QCD}$
\end_inset

 where QCD becomes strongly coupled.
 People introduced Lattice QCD to calculated QCD in this case.
 This lead to another feature of QCD: confinement, which means the force
 between quarks increasing as they are being separated.
 When the energy is high enough, another quark pair is created.
 Thus the quarks are bound into hadrons which lead to the consistent failure
 of free quark searches.

\begin_layout Subsection
Chiral symmetry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We consider the Lagrangian of two flavors massless fermions, and the results
 will be directly applicable to massless QCD.
 The Lagrangian is given by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}=i\bar{\psi_{j}}\gamma_{\mu}\partial^{\mu}\psi_{j}\label{eq:L_massless}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the index 
\emph on
j 
\emph default
presents the two different flavors (
\emph on
u
\emph default
, 
\emph on
d
\emph default
).
 Consider two transformation :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
vector transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{V}$
\end_inset

 :
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Lambda_{V}:\;\psi\rightarrow e^{-i\frac{\vec{\tau}}{2}\vec{\Theta}}\psi\simeq(1-i\frac{\vec{\tau}}{2}\vec{\Theta})\psi
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and its conjugate form:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Lambda_{V}:\;\bar{\psi}\rightarrow e^{+i\frac{\vec{\tau}}{2}\vec{\Theta}}\bar{\psi}\simeq(1+i\frac{\vec{\tau}}{2}\vec{\Theta})\bar{\psi}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{\tau}$
\end_inset

 is the Pauli-spin-matrices and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{\Theta}$
\end_inset

 are the rotation angle.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is the Dirac iso-spinor for fermions, 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=(\psi_{u},\psi_{d})$
\end_inset

.
 Clearly the Lagrangian is invariant under 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{V}$
\end_inset

 and the associated conserved current is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
V_{\mu}^{a}=\bar{\psi}\gamma_{\mu}\frac{\tau^{a}}{2}\psi
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
axial transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{A}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\Lambda_{A}:\;\psi & \rightarrow e^{-i\gamma_{5}\frac{\vec{\tau}}{2}\vec{\Theta}}\psi\simeq(1-i\gamma_{5}\frac{\vec{\tau}}{2}\vec{\Theta})\psi\\
\bar{\psi} & \rightarrow e^{-i\gamma_{5}\frac{\vec{\tau}}{2}\vec{\Theta}}\bar{\psi}\simeq(1-i\gamma_{5}\frac{\vec{\tau}}{2}\vec{\Theta})\bar{\psi}
\end{align}

\end_inset

The Lagrangian transforms as following :
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
i\bar{\psi}\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\psi\rightarrow i\bar{\psi}\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\psi-i\vec{\Theta}(\bar{\psi}i\partial_{\mu}\gamma^{\mu}\gamma_{5}\frac{\vec{\tau}}{2}\psi+\bar{\psi}\gamma_{5}\frac{\vec{\tau}}{2}i\partial_{\mu}\gamma^{\mu}\psi)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

since 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{5}$
\end_inset

 anti-commutes with 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{\mu}$
\end_inset

, the last term vanishes.
 Therefore the Lagrangian is also invariant under 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{A}$
\end_inset

 with the conserved 'axial-vector' current: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
A_{\mu}^{a}=\bar{\psi}\gamma_{\mu}\gamma_{5}\frac{\tau^{a}}{2}\psi
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, the Lagrangian of massless QCD is invariant under the vector and axial
 transformations.
 This symmetry is called 
\emph on
chiral symmetry
\emph default
.
 If we introduce a mass term in the Lagrangian.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta\mathcal{L}=-m(\bar{\psi}\psi)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

It can easily prove the 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

 is invariant under the vector transformations, but the axial transformations
 symmetry is broken.
 In case of QCD, the mass of the light quarks are very small (about 5~10
 MeV) comparing to the QCD energy scale which is about 200 MeV.
 Therefore, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{A}$
\end_inset

 should be an approximate symmetry.
 And the slight symmetry breaking due to the quark masses is called Partial
 Conserved Axial Current hypothesis (PCAC).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conservation of chiral symmetry leads to a direct deduction that the
 chiral partner which can be rotated into each other by the operation 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{A}$
\end_inset

 should have the same masses, since they should have the same Eigenvalues.
 However, in the real world, this is clearly not true, since the chiral
 partner 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}$
\end_inset

 have quite difference masses (
\begin_inset Formula $m_{\rho}=770$
\end_inset

 MeV and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{a_{1}}=1260$
\end_inset

 MeV).
 This can not be explained by the slight symmetry breaking due to the finite
 current quark masses, because this should lead to a mass difference much
 smaller than the particle mass, however, the mass difference between 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}$
\end_inset

 is of the same order as 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 mass.
 On the other hand, let us consider the weak decay of pion which is controlled
 by the matrix element of the axial current between vacuum and pion 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle 0|A_{\mu}^{a}(x)|\pi^{b}(q)\right\rangle =-if_{\pi}q_{\mu}\delta^{ab}e^{-iq\cdot x}\label{eq:pi_wd}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{\pi}$
\end_inset

 is a constant ~ 93 MeV determined from experiment.
 If we take the divergence of eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:pi_wd"

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle 0|\partial^{\mu}A_{\mu}^{a}(x)|\pi^{b}(q)\right\rangle =-if_{\pi}q_{\mu}q^{\mu}\delta^{ab}e^{-iq\cdot x}=-f_{\pi}m_{\pi}^{2}\delta^{ab}e^{-iq\cdot x}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Comparing to the hadronic scales, the pion mass is vanishing, thus the axial
 current is approximately conserved.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To solve the contradiction discussed above, the spontaneous breakdown of
 chiral symmetry was introduced.
 The breaking of symmetry has two conditions: explicit breaking, which is
 due to the explicit asymmetry in the Lagrangian, i.e.
 the finite mass of quarks in QCD; spontaneous breaking, which means the
 symmetry is not realized in the ground state.
 We considering effective potentials shown in fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:sbsc"

\end_inset

.
 Panel (a) shows a potential with ground state just in the middle.
 The ground state plus potential are invariant under rotations.
 In panel (b), any points in the valley can be the ground state.
 If we chosen as one direction as the ground state, the axial rotation symmetry
 is obviously spontaneously broken, since the Lagrangian is invariant but
 the vacuum is not.
 According to the Goldstone theorem (cite), the spontaneous breaking of
 chiral symmetry of QCD leads to the existence of eight massless Goldstone
 bosons (
\begin_inset Formula $\pi^{\pm}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi^{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $K^{\pm}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $K^{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{K^{0}}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 ), which correspond the invariant of the field under axial-vector rotations.
 And the massive particles correspond the excitations alone the radial direction.
 The assumption of spontaneously broken axial-vector symmetry also explains
 the mass difference between 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}$
\end_inset

 meson.
 Theory calculations predict that 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{a_{1}}=\sqrt{2}m_{\rho}$
\end_inset
